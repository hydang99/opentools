          "abstract": "To evaluate the impact of Japan's COVID-19 state of emergency declarations on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) volumes using Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX) modelling. This model offers methodological advantages by: (1) accounting for trends, seasonal variations and autocorrelation; (2) allowing the introduction of policy intervention periods as binary exogenous variables; and (3) enabling an accurate assessment of healthcare impacts during intermittent declaration phases while accounting for periods of subsidence.\nRetrospective observational study using a SARIMAX model.\n1377 acute care hospitals participated in Japan's Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) system between April 2018 and December 2021.\nAll patients who underwent emergency PCI (n=176 878) or elective PCI (n=272 811) during the study period, identified from a nationwide administrative database.\nThis study analysed the impact of Japan's COVID-19 state of emergency declarations as policy intervention periods, which were implemented during four waves (April to May 2020, January to March 2021, May to June 2021 and July to September 2021). Months where more than half of the days fell within a state of emergency declaration were defined as intervention periods.\nPrimary outcome measures were nationwide changes in both emergency and elective PCI volumes during state of emergency periods compared with non-emergency periods, analysed through SARIMAX modelling. Secondary outcomes included regional analyses of changes in both types of PCI volumes across eight geographical regions of Japan and the distribution analysis of medical resources (DPC hospitals, hospital beds, physicians and board-certified cardiologists per million population) in each region.\nNationwide, emergency PCI volumes totalled 176 878 and elective PCI volumes 272 811 over the 45-month study period. SARIMAX modelling indicated that the state of emergency declarations were associated with significant reductions in both emergency PCI volumes (-211.4 cases/month, 95% CI -326.9 to -95.9; -5.4%) and elective PCI volumes (-632.4 cases/month, 95% CI -1045.9 to -219.0; -10.4%). Regional analyses showed varied effects, with some areas (eg, Hokkaido, Shikoku, Kyushu) experiencing non-significant volume decreases, potentially reflecting differences in medical resource distribution and capacity.\nThe COVID-19 state of emergency declarations in Japan were associated with decreased PCI volumes. Applying SARIMAX models to real-world data could allow us to examine the effects of various events on healthcare considering trends, seasonal variation and autocorrelation by incorporating events as exogenous variables.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor, carries a dismal prognosis, with median survival remaining under 15 months despite standard therapies. This is largely because of the tumor's infiltrative nature, the restrictive blood-brain barrier, and intratumoral heterogeneity. Chlorotoxin (CTX), a 36-amino acid peptide derived from scorpion venom, has emerged as a promising multifunctional agent with high specificity for neuroectodermal tumors. In this comprehensive review, we highlight CTX's potential to address critical limitations of current glioma treatments by bridging diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Diagnostic advancements include CTX-conjugated near-IF fluorophores and nanoparticles for fluorescence-guided surgery and multimodal imaging to enhance intraoperative accuracy. On the therapeutic front, CTX enables targeted delivery of siRNA, radioisotopes, and novel immunotherapies such as CTX-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells. We also examine emerging clinical data supporting the safety and preliminary efficacy of CTX-based interventions. Collectively, CTX represents a paradigm shift in neuro-oncology, offering a single molecule with both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Its utility may also extend beyond gliomas to metastases and other malignancies within and beyond the central nervous system.",

          "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered off-label and investigational in pediatric populations with some exceptions. There are limited data on the relative rates of complications after DBS across different indications and targets in children. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of DBS surgery for children with movement disorders (MDs; dystonia, chorea, or tic disorders), drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), or neurodevelopmental disorders, namely, self-injurious behavior (SIB).\nData were collected both prospectively and retrospectively from children implanted with DBS through the North American multicenter Child and Youth CompreHensIve Longitudinal Database for Deep Brain Stimulation and included demographic, clinical, operative, and postoperative variables. Complications included infection, noninfectious surgical site findings (dehiscence or seroma), hardware-related issues (disconnection or impedance change), intracranial injury, or other complications. The primary outcome was major complications, defined as any adverse event causing permanent neurologic injury or requiring surgical intervention. The secondary outcome was minor complications, defined as nonmajor complications. Generalized linear models were used to assess for any significant associations with complications.\nA total of 130 children and youth (mean age 12.2 ± 4.2; range 3-18) years and weighing 12.5-126.6 kg underwent DBS. The most common indication was MD (77, 59.2%), followed by DRE (47, 36.2%) and SIB (6, 4.6%). Major complications occurred in 11.5%, with a greater likelihood in MD (n = 12, 15.6%) compared with DRE (n = 2, 4.3%; odds ratio [OR] 3.55, 95% CI 2.66-4.73, \nDBS-associated complications were low across multiple pediatric indications and targets, with MD associated with higher risk of major complications. Limitations include a focus on surgical postoperative complications and not stimulation-related adverse outcomes. These findings demonstrate the safety profile of DBS in children in a large cohort.",

          "abstract": "Obesity and diabetes are highly prevalent comorbidities in patients undergoing total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are novel agents that promote weight loss and glycemic control, assisting with perioperative optimization and potentially improving clinical outcomes. However, there have been safety concerns surrounding GLP-1RA use due to delayed gastric emptying and increased aspiration risk. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of GLP-1RA usage on perioperative outcomes following THA and TKA.\nPubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus (EMBASE, MEDLINE, COMPENDEX), and Cochrane databases were queried to conduct a systematic review of articles from inception to June 2025. A total of 13 studies were included (119,092 hip, 227,381 knee, 426 hip or knee). Demographics, surgical complications, medical complications, resource utilization, and revision rates were recorded at 90 days and at one and two years. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.\nThe GLP-1RA use was associated with a lower risk of 90-day PJI following TKA (odds ratio (OR), 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57 to 1.00; P = 0.047) and a lower risk of 90-day revision following THA (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P = 0.034). There was a significant decrease in 90-day readmission rates for TKA and THA with GLP-1RA use. Of note, no significant association was found between GLP-1RA use and aspiration or pneumonia (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.67; P = 0.70), but GLP-1RA usage was associated with an elevated risk of MI in the setting of TKA (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.85; P = 0.02).\nThe GLP-1RA use was associated with improved early surgical outcomes and decreased resource utilization following THA and TKA.

In these instances, use of nonstatin medications like ezetimibe, bempedoic acid, or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors (alirocumab, evolocumab, inclisiran) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy can lead to additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and beneficial reductions in cardiovascular events. This review provides an overview of the evidence supporting the use of nonstatin low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering medications for cardiovascular risk reduction and practical considerations for the use of these agents.",

          "abstract": "Obesity is a leading risk factor for fatty liver disease and weight loss has been shown to improve liver parameters. This study evaluates the efficacy of oral semaglutide for weight loss in individuals with overweight or obesity, excluding those with diabetes mellitus.\nA randomized, open-label, controlled trial was conducted at the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, from June 2022 to December 2023. Adults (≥ 18 years) with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 with comorbidities (pre-diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea or cardiovascular disease) were randomized into two groups. Both groups received counselling on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Group 1 also received oral semaglutide, starting at 3 mg/day and titrated to 14 mg/day over two to four weeks. The objectives were to assess the effects of semaglutide on weight loss, non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis and cardiometabolic parameters. (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05442450).\nTotal 116 participants (58 per group) completed the study. At 28 weeks, the mean percentage weight reduction was -10.47% (SD 5.3) in the Semaglutide group vs. -2.4% (SD 4.5) in the control group (p < 0.001). Semaglutide treatment significantly improved alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) levels, along with reductions in the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score, liver fat content and liver stiffness. However, NFS (NAFLD fibrosis score) and FIB-4 (fibrosis-4 index) did not show significant reductions. Improvements in BMI, waist circumference, HbA1c, fasting insulin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly greater with semaglutide (p < 0.001). Total fat mass decreased by 7.3 kg vs. 1.74 kg (p < 0.0001) in controls, while visceral fat ratings dropped by 3.67 vs. 0.6 (p < 0.0001).\nIn adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, oral semaglutide, combined with dietary and lifestyle modifications, led to significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and metabolic improvements compared to lifestyle modifications alone.",

No secondary outcomes favored either treatment group. The risk difference for symptomatic hemorrhage between the argatroban and eptifibatide arms vs placebo was -0.8% (\nOutcomes in patients treated with IVT-O were not improved by adding either argatroban or eptifibatide. Increased bleeding was not observed, but mortality was higher in both investigational arms. Limitations included small sample size in the argatroban subgroup.\nThis study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT03735979) on November 8, 2018. The first patient was enrolled on October 15, 2019.\nThis study provides Class II evidence that in patients with AIS treated with IVT within 3 hours of onset, argatroban or eptifibatide does not improve outcomes vs thrombolysis alone but does increase mortality.",

This study aimed to identify risk factors for severity, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and survival time, and develop a survival prediction model. Data from 70 lung cancer patients with ICI-related myocarditis (training set) and 40 patients (validation set) were analyzed, with ≥ 1.5 years of follow-up. Cox regression was employed to determine factors associated with survival time, and Logistic regression models identified risk factors for severe myocarditis and MACE. Several factors were independently associated with all-cause death: protective factors included combined radiotherapy (HR 0.12, 95%CI: 0.01-0.98, p = 0.047) and longer ICI treatment duration (≥ 132 days, HR 0.93, 95%CI: 0.91-0.98, p = 0.013); risk factors included low-dose glucocorticoid use in patients with severe myocarditis (HR 3.92, 95%CI: 1.16-13.2, p = 0.028). A nomogram model constructed based on these three variables yielded area under the time-ROC curves of 0.832, 0.835, and 0.924 for 0.5-, 1-, and 1.5-year survival in the training set, and 0.821, 0.806, and 0.789 in the validation set, respectively. It also demonstrated good discriminative ability and clinical utility for predicting survival in lung cancer patients with ICI-related myocarditis, as this study established a validated nomogram model that may aid survival prediction in this population. Additionally, we analyzed the risk factors for severe ICI related myocarditis and 90-day MACE. We found that the use of angiogenesis inhibitors was an independent risk factor for severe myocarditis (OR 18.72, 95% CI: 2.52-428.27, p = 0.02); a history of coronary artery disease (OR 10.54, 95% CI: 1.62-210.10, p = 0.037) was an independent risk factor for 90-day MACE; and left ventricular ejection fraction (OR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99, p = 0.026) was an independent protective factor against 90-day MACE.",

We aimed to assess whether comprehensive whole-genome sequencing (WGS) linked to mortality data could add prognostic value to existing clinical measures and identify patients who might respond to targeted therapeutics.\nIn this integrative, retrospective analysis, we analysed 2445 breast cancer tumours (any stage and molecular subtype) collected from 2403 patients recruited through 13 National Health Service Genomic Medicine Centres or hospitals in England affiliated to the 100 000 Genomes Project (100kGP) between 2012 and 2018. We linked 2208 (90%) cases with clinical data; mortality data were obtained for 1188 patients. Following high-depth WGS of tumour and matched normal DNA, we performed comprehensive WGS profiling seeking driver mutations, mutational signatures, and compound algorithmic scores for homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), mismatch repair deficiency, and tumour mutational burden. Data from 1803 additional patients with breast cancer from three independent cohorts were used to validate various findings. To evaluate the prognostic value of WGS features, we performed univariable and multivariable Cox regression on data from patients with stage I-III, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with a cancer-specific mortality endpoint (around 5-year follow-up).\nAmong 2445 tumours in the 100kGP breast cancer cohort, we observed genomic characteristics with immediate personalised medicine potential in 656 (26·8%), including features reporting HRD (298 [12·2%] total cases and 76 [6·3%] ER-positive, HER2-negative cases), highly individualised driver events, mutations underpinning resistance to endocrine therapy, and mutational signatures indicating therapeutic vulnerabilities. 373 (15·2%) cases had WGS features with potential for translational research, including compromised base excision repair and non-homologous end-joining dependency.

This study aims to investigate the impact of PD-L1 on the signaling pathways in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.\nThe regulatory role of PD-L1 was investigated through in vitro manipulation of PD-L1 expression across several EGFR-mutant cell lines, followed by analysis via human receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array, Western blotting, protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) activity assays, and mRNA expression profiling. In vivo experiments were carried out using xenograft mice implanted with parental, PD-L1 knock-out and PD-L1 overexpression NCI-H1975 cells.

We designed this study to investigate whether sublingual microcirculation monitoring can serve as an effective marker for assessing the efficacy of resuscitation therapy in septic shock.\nA total of 72 septic shock patients were included in our final analysis, excluding those with heart function impairments, including sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy. Sublingual microcirculation parameters were measured at two time points: prior to resuscitation and 6 hours post-resuscitation. Additionally, the values of macrocirculatory parameters, blood gas analysis variables, and organ prognosis indicators were collected at multiple time points before and after resuscitation. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlations among these variables. Furthermore, the ROC curve analysis method was employed to evaluate the predictive performance of sublingual microcirculation parameters and other relevant factors for patient prognosis. Finally we determined the optimal threshold of PPV6h by anchoring it to three key aspects: tissue oxygenation (Lac24h), organ dysfunction progression (△APACHE II3d and △SOFA3d), and long-term outcomes (Adverse Prognosis and 28-day mortality).\nSublingual microcirculation variables post-resuscitation showed no significant correlation with conventional circulation variables. PPV6h had the highest predictive efficacy for 28-day prognosis, better than PcvO26h, the best predictor among conventional variables. The optimal PPV6h threshold (68.6%) was determined using three key criteria mentioned above. Patients meeting this threshold after resuscitation showed improved microcirculation (lower lactate levels and faster clearance), reduced organ dysfunction (lower APACHE II and SOFA scores, less need for CRRT), and better long-term outcomes (fewer vasoactive drugs, 28-day lower mortality).\nOur study highlights the potential utility of sublingual microcirculation as an adjunctive tool for reflecting the effectiveness of resuscitation therapy and proposes that the PPV6h > 68.6% may serve as a target for early goal-directed therapy in future studies.",

Patients meeting this threshold after resuscitation showed improved microcirculation (lower lactate levels and faster clearance), reduced organ dysfunction (lower APACHE II and SOFA scores, less need for CRRT), and better long-term outcomes (fewer vasoactive drugs, 28-day lower mortality).\nOur study highlights the potential utility of sublingual microcirculation as an adjunctive tool for reflecting the effectiveness of resuscitation therapy and proposes that the PPV6h > 68.6% may serve as a target for early goal-directed therapy in future studies.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the long-term safety profiles of ocrelizumab and rituximab in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).\nUsing retrospective data from the University of California (UC) Health System, we simulated a target clinical trial. The primary cohort from UC San Francisco (UCSF) and a validation cohort from 5 other UC Medical Centers were analyzed. After applying exclusion criteria and propensity score matching based on disease characteristics, demographics, and socioeconomic factors, we compared UCSF patients receiving ocrelizumab (n = 542) and rituximab (n = 271)and validated in the UC-wide MS population (n = 486 and n = 162 patients, respectively). The primary outcome was an all-cause hospitalization rate; secondary outcomes included hypogammaglobulinemia development and infection incidence.\nRituximab showed higher all-cause hospitalization rates compared to ocrelizumab in both UCSF (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37-3.82, p = 0.001) and UC-wide cohorts (IRR = 4.54, 95% CI = 4.30-7.61, p < 0.001). Cumulative hazard ratios (HRs) were similarly elevated with rituximab at UCSF (HR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.37-3.75, p = 0.001) and UC-wide (HR = 4.01, 95% CI = 2.25-6.32, p < 0.001).

          "abstract": "Stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) are the first-line pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although stimulants are effective at a group level, individual response varies, which advocates for tailored treatment approaches. Prior studies suggested that neurobiological measures following a single dose of stimulants are indicative of longer-term clinical response. To expand these findings, we tested whether an association between acute and longer-term treatment response can also be identified using measures commonly used in clinic. Sixty adults with ADHD completed clinico-neuropsychological measures, including the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV (BAARS-IV) and the Quantitative behavior (Qb) test, following a single dose of MPH (20 mg) and placebo. These measures were repeated after two-month MPH treatment to ascertain response. We tested associations between single-dose and longer-term response using univariate and multivariable (Lasso) regression approaches. We also ran correlations between predicted and true outcome measures. Univariate regressions showed significant associations between single-dose and two-month improvement in BAARS hyperactivity/impulsivity and Qb scores (all p < 0.001 but Qb activity, p = 0.006). Multivariable models including acute response and baseline clinicodemographic measures yielded significant correlations between predicted and actual values for all BAARS-IV and Qb scores at follow-up, except for BAARS inattention and Qb activity. Most had large/very large effect size (up to r = 0.69). These findings suggest that specific clinico-neuropsychological changes following a single dose of MPH may be indicative of longer-term treatment response, especially when combined with pre-treatment clinico-demographic characteristics. Once validated in larger and more heterogeneous samples, these results may support more informed and individualized treatment approaches for ADHD.",

Sixty adults with ADHD completed clinico-neuropsychological measures, including the Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV (BAARS-IV) and the Quantitative behavior (Qb) test, following a single dose of MPH (20 mg) and placebo.

We tested associations between single-dose and longer-term response using univariate and multivariable (Lasso) regression approaches. We also ran correlations between predicted and true outcome measures. Univariate regressions showed significant associations between single-dose and two-month improvement in BAARS hyperactivity/impulsivity and Qb scores (all p < 0.001 but Qb activity, p = 0.006). Multivariable models including acute response and baseline clinicodemographic measures yielded significant correlations between predicted and actual values for all BAARS-IV and Qb scores at follow-up, except for BAARS inattention and Qb activity.

Thus, bisphosphonates, apart from being the treatment of choice for certain groups of patients, are also indispensable for the consolidation and maintenance of the gains of all other treatments, providing, in addition, the opportunity of temporary treatment arrest.

However, their hematopoietic effect can cause polycythemia in rare cases. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and two-year outcomes of patients with IgAN with SGLT2 inhibitor-induced polycythemia.\nWe retrospectively analyzed data of adult patients with IgAN treated with dapagliflozin (DAPA) at our department between 2021 and 2023. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they developed polycythemia within 24 months of initiating DAPA therapy (those who developed polycythemia were in the polycythemia (P) group, and those who did not were in the normal (N) group). Clinical characteristics and cardio-renal outcomes were evaluated at baseline and three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months post-SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and compared between the groups.\nOf the 174 patients screened, 28 were included. Compared to the N group (n=18), the P group (n=10) had a higher proportion of men, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia, and higher body weight and higher red blood cell count at baseline. Polycythemia developed even in patients with high baseline hemoglobin (Hb) levels; however, these returned to baseline levels within two years. Systolic blood pressure and proteinuria levels decreased significantly over the two-year period in both groups, but the decrease was slower in the P group than in the N group. No cardiovascular events occurred in either group during the follow-up period.\nThe SGLT2 inhibitor-induced polycythemia in patients with IgAN was transient and did not affect the two-year cardio-renal outcomes. Therefore, our findings suggest that continuing SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in these patients may be reasonable, as the condition appeared to be transient and did not adversely affect cardio-renal outcomes.",

However, their hematopoietic effect can cause polycythemia in rare cases. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and two-year outcomes of patients with IgAN with SGLT2 inhibitor-induced polycythemia.\nWe retrospectively analyzed data of adult patients with IgAN treated with dapagliflozin (DAPA) at our department between 2021 and 2023. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they developed polycythemia within 24 months of initiating DAPA therapy (those who developed polycythemia were in the polycythemia (P) group, and those who did not were in the normal (N) group). Clinical characteristics and cardio-renal outcomes were evaluated at baseline and three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months post-SGLT2 inhibitor initiation and compared between the groups.\nOf the 174 patients screened, 28 were included. Compared to the N group (n=18), the P group (n=10) had a higher proportion of men, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia, and higher body weight and higher red blood cell count at baseline. Polycythemia developed even in patients with high baseline hemoglobin (Hb) levels; however, these returned to baseline levels within two years. Systolic blood pressure and proteinuria levels decreased significantly over the two-year period in both groups, but the decrease was slower in the P group than in the N group.

This retrospective cohort study evaluated the impact of integrating HCV treatment into an HIV care setting at a medical center in Taiwan. Among 345 PWH receiving 387 treatment courses of DAAs from 2019 to 2024, the median time to treatment initiation has decreased from 421.5 days in 2019 to 31 days in 2022-2024 following the integration of HIV and HCV care. Treatment completion was 99.2%, and the overall sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) was 95.1%. No significant differences in SVR12 were observed across the treatment years or between rapid (less than 30 days) versus standard initiation of DAAs. Among 368 individuals who achieved SVR12, 303 (82.3%) had at least one post-treatment HCV RNA test showing undetectable viremia. The median follow-up duration was 33.4 months (IQR, 16.6-53.4), with 45 reinfections identified-yielding an incidence rate of 4.87 per 100 person-years of follow-up (95% CI, 3.66-6.48). Reinfection occurred in both early and standard treatment groups, with most individuals with reinfections receiving DAA retreatment. These findings suggest that embedding HCV care within HIV services can dramatically expedite treatment access to DAAs while maintaining high cure rates.

Preeclampsia was induced by administering L-NAME in drinking water from gestational days 6-19.\nNeither dietary salicylates nor aspirin, at either dose, affected blood pressure in L-NAME-treated rats. The lower dose of dietary salicylates significantly reduced urinary albumin levels. Both interventions prevented an increase in the sFlt/PLGF ratio and mitigated histopathological placental changes in preeclamptic rats. The higher dose of aspirin reduced placental VEGFR2 protein levels.\nDietary salicylate supplementation does not provide clear preventive effects against preeclampsia.",

This study, involving a population-based cohort, used health insurance data to investigate potential vaccine-related major outcomes, including cardiac, pulmonary, and thromboembolic diseases.\nThis retrospective cohort study involved data from 2,017,884 vaccinated (at least two doses) individuals and 334,583 unvaccinated individuals. The incidences of myocarditis, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, and cerebrovascular disease were compared between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated groups at 1 week to 3 months after vaccination.\nThe study population had a mean age of 54 years (male: 44.6%). Among the vaccinated, 57.7% received the mRNA vaccine only, whereas 35.5% received the adenoviral vector vaccine alone. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that vaccination was significantly associated with the early development of myocarditis. The mRNA vaccine, a younger age, and retrohyperlipidemia were independent indicators of poor myocarditis prognosis after vaccination. However, the incidence of myocardial infarction at 1-2 weeks post-vaccination, as well as pulmonary thromboembolism and cerebrovascular disease (both at 3 months post-vaccination), were significantly lower in the vaccinated group when compared with the unvaccinated one. However, there was no significant association between vaccination and interstitial lung disease, atrial fibrillation, or deep vein thrombosis.\nThe younger male population (age: < 45 years) should be cautious about receiving the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and should be closely monitored for myocarditis after vaccination.
