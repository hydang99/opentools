The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R3 R3' starting from the state shown in the image.

            "extracted_text": "Tags used in HTML\nHTML Tags\nThis is a list of tags used in the\nHTML\nlanguage.  Each tag starts\nwith a tag opener (a less than sign) and ends with a tag closer (a\ngreater than sign).   Many tags have corresponding closing tags which\nidentical except for a slash after the tag opener. (For example, the\nTITLE\ntag).\nSome tags take parameters, called attributes. The attributes are given\nafter the tag, separated by spaces. Certain attributes have an effect\nsimply by their presence, others are followed by an equals sign and\na value. (See the\nAnchor\ntag, for example). The names of tags and\nattributes are not case sensitive: they may be in lower, upper, or\nmixed case with exactly the same meaning.  (In this document they\nare generally represented in upper case.)\nCurrently HTML documents are transmitted without the normal SGML framing\ntags, but if these are included parsers will ignore them.\nTitle\nThe title of a document is given between title tags:\n...\nThe text between the opening and the closing tags is a title for the\nhypertext node. There should only be one title in any node. It should\nidentify the content of the node in a fairly wide context, and should\nideally fit on one line.\nThe title is not strictly part of the text of the document, but is\nan attribute of the node. It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks,\nor highlighting. the title may be used to identify the node in a history\nlist, to label the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally\ndisplayed in the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with\nheadings\n.\nNext ID\nObsolete: NeXT Browser only.  May be ignored. This tag takes a  single\nattribute which is the number of the next document-wide numeric identifier\nto be allocated (not good SGML). Note that when modifying a document,\nold anchor ids should not be reused, as there may be references stored\nelsewhere which point to them.  This is read and generated by hypertext\neditors. Human writers of HTML usually use mnemonic alpha identifiers.\nBrowser software may ignore this tag. Example of use:\nBase Address\nAnchors\nspecify addresses of other documents, in a from relative to\nthe address of the current document. Normally, the address of a document\nis known to the browser because it was used to access the document.\nHowever, is a document is mailed, or is somehow visible with more\nthan one address (for example, via its filename and also via its library\nname server catalogue number), then the browser needs to know the\nbase address in order to correctly deduce external document addresses.\nThe format of this tag is not yet specified. NOT CURRENTLY USED\nAnchors\nThe format of an anchor is as follows:\n...\nThe text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either the\nstart or destination (or both) of a link. Attributes of the anchor\ntag are as follows.\nHREF\nIf the HREF attribute is present, the anchor is senstive text:\nthe start of a link. If the reader selects this text,  he should be\npresented with another document whose network address is defined by\nthe value of the HREF attribute . The format of the network address\nis specified\nelsewhere\n. This allows for the form HREF=#identifier\nto refer to another anchor in the same document. If the anchor is\nin another document, the atribute is a\nrelative name\n, relative to\nthe documents address (or specified\nbase address\nif any).\nNAME\nThe attribute NAME allows the anchor to be the destination of\na link. The value of the parameter is that part of a hypertext address\nwhich follows the\nhash sign\n.\nTYPE\nAn attribute TYPE may give the relationship described by the\nhyertext link. The type is expressed by a string for extensibility.\nStrings for types with particular semantics will be registered by\nthe W3 team. The default relationship if none other is given is void.\nAll attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is necessary\nfor the anchor to be useful.\nIsIndex\nThis tag informs the reader that the document is an index document.\nAs well as reading it, the reader may use a keyword search.\nFormat:\nThe node may be queried with a keyword search by suffixing the node\naddress with a question mark, followed by a list of keywords separated\nby plus signs. See the\nnetwork address format\n.\nPlaintext\nThis tag indicates that all following text is to be taken litterally,\nup to the end of the file.  Plain text is designed to be represented\nin the same way as example XMP text, with fixed width character and\nsignificant line breaks. Format:\nThis tag allows the rest of a file to be read efficiently without\nparsing. Its presence is an optimisation. There is no closing tag.\nExample sections\nThese styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded absolutely\nas is into the document. The format is:\n...\nThe text between these tags is to be portrayed in a fixed width font,\nso that any formatting done by character spacing on successive lines\nwill be maintained. Between the opening and closing tags:\nThe text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters, including\nthe tag opener, so long as it does not contain the closing tag in\nfull.\nLine boundaries are significant, and are to be interpreted as a move\nto the start of a new line.\nThe ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character should be interpreted as the\nsmallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number\nof characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not\nrecommended however.\nThe LISTING tag is portrayed so that at least 132 characters will\nfit on a line.  The XMP tag is portrayed in a font so that at least\n80 characters will fit on a line but is otherwise identical to LISTING.\nThe examples of markup are here given using the XMP tag.\nParagraph\nThis tag indicates a new paragraph. The exact representation of this\n(indentation,  leading, etc) is not defined here, and may be a function\nof other tags, style sheets etc. The format is simply\n(In SGML terms, paragraph elements are transmitted in minimised form).\nHeadings\nSeveral levels (at least six) of heading are supported. Note that\na hypertext document tends to need less levels of  heading than a\nnormal document whose only structure is given by the nesting of headings.\nH1 is the highest level of heading, and is recommened for the start\nof a hypertext node.   It is suggested that the first heading be one\nsuitable for a reader who is already browsing in related information,\nin contrast to the\ntitle\ntag which should identify the node in a wider\ncontext.\n,\n        ,\n        ,\n        ,\n        ,\nThese tags are kept as defined in the CERN SGML guide. Their definition\nis completely historical, deriving from the\nAAP\ntag set.  A difference\nis that HTML documents allow headings to be terminated by  closing\ntags:\nSecond level heading\nAddress\nThis tag is for address information, signatures, etc, normally at\nthe top or bottom of a document. typically, it is italic and/or right\njustified or indented. The  format is:\ntext ...\nHighlighting\nThe highlighted phrase tags may occur in normal text, and may be nested.\nFor each opening tag there must follow a corresponding closing tag.\nNOT CURRENTLY USED.\n...\n...\netc.\nGlossaries\nA glosary (or definition list) is a list of paragraphs each of which\nhas a short title alongside it.  Apart from glossaries, this format\nis useful for presenting a set of named elements to the reader. The\nformat is as follows:\nTerm\ndefinition pagagraph\nTerm2\nDefinition of term2\nLists\nA list is a sequence of paragraphs, each of which is preceded by a\nspecial mark or sequence number. The format is:\nlist element\nanother list element ...\nThe opening list tag  must be immediately followed by the first list\nelement. The representation of the list is not defined here, but a\nbulleted list for unordered lists,  and a  sequence of numbered paragraphs\nfor an ordered list would be quite appropriate.  Other possibilities\nfor interactive display include embedded scrollable browse panels.\nOpening list tags are:\nUL\nA list multi-line paragraphs, typically separated by some white\nspace.\nMENU\nA list of smaller paragraphs. Typically one line per item, with\na style more compact than UL.\nDIR\nA list of short elements, less than one line. Typical style is\nto arrange in four columns or provide a browser, etc.\nthe closing tag must obviously match the opening tag."

            "extracted_text": "/private/Net/cernvax/userd/tbl/hypertext/WWW/DesignIssues/Formats.rtf\nDocument formats\nThe question of the format of the contents of a node is independent\nof the format of all the management information (except for the format\nof the anchor position within the node content). Therefore, the hypertext\nsystem can be largely defined without specifying the node format.\nHowever, agreement must be reached between client and server about\nhow they exchange content information. Many hypertext systems qualify\nas ｪhypermediaｺ systems because they handle media other than plain\ntext. Examples are graphics, video and sound clips, object-oriented\ngraphics definitions, marked-up text, etc.\nFormat negotiation\nMost hypermedia systems on the market today have the same application\nprogram responsible for the hypertext navigation and for the browsing.\nIt would be safer to separate these features as much as possible:\notherwise, in defining a universal hypertext system, one is burdened\nwith defining a universal multimedia browser. This would certainly\nnot stand the test of time. Node content must be left free to evolve.\nThis implies that format conversion facilities must be available to\nallow simple browsers to access data which is stored in a sophisticated\nformat. Such conversion facilities tend to exist in many applications,\nthough not, in general, in hypertext applications.\nThe format of the content of a node should be as flexible as possible.\nHaving more than one format is not useful from the user's point of\nview -- only from the point of view of an evolving system.  I suggest\nthe following rules:\n1. Basic formats\nThere is a set of formats which every client must be able to handle.\nThese include 80-column text and basic hypertext  (\nHTML\n).\n2. Conversion\nA server providing a format which is not in the basic set of formats\nrequired for a client must have the possibility of generating some\nsort of conversion of the text (even if necessary an apology for non-conversion\nin the case of graphics to text) for a client which cannot handle\nit.  This ensures universal readability world over.\n3. Negotiation\nFor every format, there must be a set of other possible formats which\nthe server can convert it into, and the most desirable format is selected\nby negotiation between the two parties. The negotiation must take\ninto account:\nthe expected translation time, including current load factors\nthe expected data degradation\nthe expected transmission time (?!!)\nThe times one could assume will be roughly proportional to the length\nof the document, or at least linear in it.\nApplication-specific node formats (e.g. physics event) would allow\nspecialized browsers to perform local processing. This is a natural\nextension of the hierarchy of node formats. I would suggest one stick\nto the rule that a server providing such a type of data must provide\nsome default conversion to a standardized view.\nAn index or a keyword could be a specific node format which would\nbe manageable by a browser.\nExamples\nExamples of rich text formats which exist already at CERN are as follows,\nwith, in brackets after each, other formats into which it might be\nconvertible:\nSGML\n(\nTex\n,  Postscript, plain text)\nBookmaster (Postscript, I3812, plain text)\nTeX  (DVI, plain text)\nDVI \n(IBM 3812, Postscript, etc)\nMicrosoft RTF (postscript, \nplain text, Next ｪWriteNowｺ) -\nSee Specs\nPostscript,\nEditable Postscript\n(IBM 3812 bitmap)\nplain text\nWhen a server (or browser) is obliged to perform a conversion from\none format to another, one imagines that the result would be cached\nso that, if the same conversion were needed later, it would be available\nmore rapidly. Format conversion, like notification of new material,\nis something which can be triggered either by the writer or by the\nbrowser. In many cases, a conversion from, say, SGML into Postscript\nor plain text would be made immediately on entry of the new material,\nand kept until the source has been updated (See\ncaching\n,\ndesign issues\n)."

This allows\nsome limited trivial nesting (eg LI within UL) but no general nesting,\nas a finite and small set of styles is used.

A more enlightening view is of\nan Autonomous System as a collection of\nCIDR\nIP address prefixes under common technical management.\nFor example, the CIDR block from 208.130.28.0 to 208.130.31.255,\nas well as network 201.64.75.0 might be AS 2934.\nLet's say a host in another network tried to connect to 208.130.28.2.\nMost likely a series a default routes would deliver the traffic\nto an ISP router with a\ndefaultless\nrouting table.\nThis router, and others in the Internet backbone, would then\nroute the traffic according to its rules for AS 2934.\nOnce the traffic reaches AS 2934, an interior routing protocol\n(such as OSPF) would be used to deliver the packets to their\nfinal destination.\nIf you draw a network map of AS's,\nthree distinct types can be identified:\nA\nStub AS\nis only connected to one other AS.

A Stub AS can usually have a\ndefault route to its parent.  A Transit AS must use default-less routers.\nA Multihomed AS may use either default-less routing, or\nsetup a default route to one of its neighbor AS's,\nbut this will probably result in poor quality routing.\nExterior routing\n, with a routing protocol\nsuch as\nBGP\n, is used to interconnect the\nvarious AS's, with their independant interior routing protocols,\ninto a single coherent Internet.\nNext:\nAcronyms\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nAutonomous System AS"

It can be\nin one of two\nstates - off or on,\n            0 or 1.  The meaning of the bit, which can\nrepresent almost anything, is unimportant at this point.\nThe thing to remember is that\nall\ncomputer data - a text\nfile on disk, a program in memory, a packet on a network -\nis ultimately a collection of bits.\nIf one bit has two different states, how many states\ndo two bits have?  The answer is four.\nLikewise, three bits have eight states.\nFor example, if a computer display had eight colors available,\nand you wished to select one of these to draw a diagram in,\nthree bits would be sufficient to represent this information.\nEach of the eight colors would be assigned to one of\nthe three-bit combinations.  Then, you could pick    one of the colors\nby picking the right three-bit combination.\nA common and convenient grouping of bits is the\nbyte\nor\noctet\n, composed of eight bits.  If two bits have four combinations,\nand three bits have eight combinations, how many combinations do\neight bits have?  If you don't want to\nwrite out all the possible byte patterns,\njust multiply eight twos together - one two for each bit.\nTwo times two is four, so the number of combinations of two bits is four.\nTwo times two times two is eight, so the number of combinations of three\nbits is eight.\nDo this eight times - or just compute two to the eighth power -\nand you discover that a byte has 256 possible states.\nObviously, if a byte has 256 possible states, its exact state can\nbe represented by a number from 1 to 256.\nHowever, since zero is a very important number, a byte is more typically\nrepresented by a number from 0 to 255.\nThis is very common, and with bit pattern\n00000000\nrepresenting zero,\nand bit pattern\n11111111\nrepresenting 255.\nThe numbers matching these two patterns, and everything in between, can\nbe computed by assigning a weight to each bit, multiplying each bit's\nvalue (0 or 1) by its weight, and then adding the totals.  For example,\nhere's how 217 is represented as\n11011001\nin binary:\nTo convert a number from decimal to binary, begin at leftmost bit\nposition (128).  If the number is larger than or equal to the bit's weight,\nwrite a 1 in the bit position, subtract\nthe bit's weight from the number, and continue with the difference.\nIf the number is less than the bit's weight, write a 0 in the bit\nposition and continue without any subtraction.  Here's an illustration\nof converting 141 to binary:\nThere is a simpler way to convert bytes back and forth between binary\nand decimal; akin to memorizing multiplication tables.\nThe byte can split into two four-bit halves,\neach half called a\nnibble\n.  Memorize the decimal values\nfor the high nibble (they're just the multiples of 16).\nThe low nibble is trivial.\nEvery number between 0 and 255 is the sum of one of the high nibble\nvalues and one of the low nibble values.  Write the high nibble\nnext to the low nibble, and you have the byte value in binary.\nConversely, an eight-bit binary byte can be split in half,\neach nibble converted to decimal and two decimal numbers added together.\nThe most common bit patterns in Internet engineering are those\nwith a string of one bits, followed by a string of zero bits.\nHere are all such bytes, along with their decimal representation,\ncomputed just like the example using 217.\nNext:\nBridging\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nBinary Arithmetic"

Given the exact same input twice, the hash function\nshould always produce the same output.  Even a single bit changed in\nthe input, though, should produce a different hash value.\nThe hash value should be small enough to\nbe manageable in further manipulations,\nyet large enough to prevent an attacker from\nrandomly finding a block of data that produces the same hash.\nMD5, documented in\nRFC 1321,\nis perhaps the most widely used hash function at this time (2001).\nIt takes an arbitrarily sized block of data as input and produces\na 128-bit (16-byte) hash.  It uses bitwise operations, addition,\nand a table of values based on the sine function to process\nthe data in 64-byte blocks.\nRFC 1810\ndiscusses the performance of MD5, and presents some speed measurements\nfor various architectures.\nThe other major hash function is NIST's Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA),\nspecified in\nFIPS PUB 180-1\n.\nIt is similar to MD5 in that it does various bit shuffling to process\nthe input data in blocks.  SHA's output is a 160-bit hash.\nHash functions can't be used directly for encryption, but are very useful\nfor authentication.  One of the simplest uses of a hash function\nis to protect passwords.  UNIX systems, in particular, will\napply a hash function to a user's password and store the hash\nvalue, not the password itself.  To authenticate the user, a password\nis requested, and the response run through the hash function.  If\nthe resulting hash value is the same as the one stored, then the\nuser must have supplied the correct password, and is authenticated.\nSince the hash function is irreversible, obtaining the hash values\ndoesn't reveal the passwords to an attacker.  In practice, though,\npeople will often use guessable passwords, so obtaining the hashes\nmight reveal passwords to an attacker who, for example, hashes all\nthe words in the dictionary and compares the results to the password\nhashes.\nAnother use of hash functions is for interactive authentication\nover the network.  Transmitting a hash instead of an actual password\nhas the advantage of not revealing the password to anyone sniffing\non the network traffic.  If the password is combined with some\nchanging value, then the hashes will be different every time,\npreventing an attacker from using an old hash to authenticate again.\nThis approach is used in\nPPP\n's CHAP authentication\nscheme.  The server sends a random challenge to the client, which\ncombines the challenge with the password, computes the hash value,\nand sends it back to the server.  The server, possessing both the\nstored secret password and the random challenge, performs the same\nhash computation, and checks its result against the reply from the\nclient.  If they match, then the client must known the password\nto have correctly computed the hash value.  Since the next authentication\nwould involve a different random challenge, the expected hash value\nwould be different, preventing an attacker from using a replay\nattack.\nA slight variant of this scheme can be used to generate data\nsignatures.  Assume that both the sender and recipient of some data\nmessage share a secret value.  Then, by combining the data message\nwith the secret, and running it through a hash function, a signature\nis generated in the form of the hash value.  The data message is\ntransmitted along with the signature.  The recipient combines the\nreceived message with the secret, generates a hash value, and checks\nto make sure it's identical to the signature.  The message's\nauthenticity is thus verified.  The widely used HMAC\n(\nRFC 2104\n) algorithm is based on this\nidea.\nThus, hash functions, though not encryption algorithms in their own\nright, can be used to provide significant security services, mainly\nidentity authentication.  Furthermore, as the next page discusses,\nhash functions can be easily converted into full-blown encryption\nalgorithms, and thus form the basis for all modern cryptosystems.\nNext:\nBlock Ciphers\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nHash Functions"

Remote logins, file transfers, mail delivery - all use streams.\nA stream appears to be like a pipeline.  It has two endpoints.  Data\nis put in one end and comes out the other.  None of the data is duplicated,\nor discarded, or reorganized in any way.  Two streams can be paired\ntogether to form a full duplex connection.\nA\ndatagram\n, often called a\npacket\n,\nis much more atomic in nature.  It is a small piece\nof data, often required to be less than a maximum length (typically\nin the 256 to 2000 byte range).  Datagrams are completely self contained.\nThey have a source and a destination,\nbut nothing that could be called a connection.\nDatagrams have no relationship to any others that came before or after\nthem.\nAlthough most networking communication uses streams, all Internet transfers\nare in the form of datagrams.  Internet streams are actually\nemulated using datagrams by the\nTCP\nProtocol\n.  To diagnose Internet operation, a\npacket decoder\nsuch as\nTCPdump\nis used to view individual packets.  This, along with a knowledge of\nTCP operation, enables the Internet engineer to assemble a mental\npicture of network operation.\nNext:\nDomain Names\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nDatagrams and Streams"

Consider a 200MHz Pentium-based host\ntransmitting data to a 25MHz 80386/SX.  Obviously, the Pentium will\nbe able to drown the slower processor with data.  Likewise, consider\ntwo hosts, each using an Ethernet LAN, but with the\ntwo Ethernets connected by a 28.8 Kbps modem link.  If one host begins\ntransmitting to the other at Ethernet speeds,\nthe modem link will quickly become overwhelmed.\nIn both cases,\nflow control\nis needed to pace\nthe data transfer at an acceptable speed.\nRequest/reply flow control requires each data packet to be acknowledge\nby the remote host before the next packet is sent.  Sliding window\nalgorithms, used by TCP, permit multiple data packets to be in\nsimultaneous transit, making more efficient use of network bandwidth.\nFinally, Internet's\nUnreliable\nDelivery Model\nallows packets to be discarded if network resources\nare not available, and demands that protocols make provisions for\nretransmission.\nRequest/Reply\nSliding Window\nNext:\nRequest/Reply\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nFlow Control"

Sometimes referred to as\nping-pong\nbehavior, request/reply is simple to understand and implement,\nbut not very efficient.  In LAN topologies with fast links,\nthis isn't much of a concern, but WAN links will spend most\nof their time idle, especially if several hops are required.\nSome protocols pretty much require request/reply behavior.\nFor example, Internet's\nRemote Procedure\nCall (RPC)\nProtocol is used to implement subroutine calls from\na program on one machine to library routines on another machine.\nSince most programs are single threaded, the sender has little choice\nbut to wait for a reply before continuing the program and possibly\nsending another request.  Hopefully, our language and compiler\ntechnology will someday easily support multi threaded code, but\nuntil then RPC will remain largely a request/reply protocol.\nNext:\nSliding Window\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nRequest/Reply"
