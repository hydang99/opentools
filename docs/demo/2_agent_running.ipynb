        "\n",
        "This notebook compares several agent styles **before** you see their traces. At a high level:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ZeroShot**: Single LLM call, **no tools**, no explicit planning. Fast and cheap, but can be brittle on harder tasks. The result dictionary mainly has a `direct_output` string.\n",
        "- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Still **no tools**, but the LLM is prompted to reason step-by-step. You will usually see a longer textual reasoning trace and a final answer in `direct_output`.\n",
        "- **ReAct**: Alternates between **Thought → Action (tool) → Observation**. The logs show multiple \"ReAct Reasoning Cycle\" steps, tool calls, and observations, followed by a **Final Answer** section.\n",
        "- **OctoTools**: Uses a more structured **plan → tool calls → memory** loop. The trace is broken into named steps such as *Query Analysis*, *Action Prediction*, *Command Generation*, *Command Execution*, and *Context Verification*, plus a final summary.\n",
        "- **OpenTools (more detailed)**: Think of this as a **small team of sub-agents** working together:\n",
        "  1. **Input**: You pass a single `question` (and optional `image_path` / extra kwargs) into `UnifiedSolver(..., agent_name=\"opentools\", ...)`.\n",
        "  2. **Reasoner sub-agent**: Reads the question (and global memory) and breaks it into a **sub-problem** like “find this paper” or “compute this quantity and explain it”. This shows up in the logs as `sub_problem=...`.\n",
        "  3. **Tool-call generator**: Given that sub-problem, it decides **which tools** to call (e.g. `Arxiv_Paper_Search_Tool`, `Search_Engine_Tool`, `Visual_AI_Tool`) and with what arguments. You will see a list of `Generated Tool calls: [...]`.\n",
        "  4. **Executor**: Actually runs those tools and records raw results (JSON, text, etc.). This is where you see `Executed Tool calls: [...]` with concrete outputs.\n",
        "  5. **Verifier**: Checks whether the tool results really answer the sub-problem, may clean up the output, and writes a concise summary.\n",
        "  6. **Global memory**: The verified summary is stored in a shared memory dict (keyed by step index). Later reasoning cycles can **read this memory** instead of re-calling tools.\n",
        "  7. **Loop + stopping**: Steps 2–6 repeat, using the growing memory, until the reasoner marks `stop=True`.\n",
        "  8. **Final answer**: A final summarization step reads from global memory and produces a **single, user-facing answer**. In Python, you’ll see this in `result[\"direct_output\"]` or `result[\"final_output\"]`, while the long trace (logs + memory) explains how that answer was constructed.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you only care about the answer, focus on `direct_output` / `final_output`. If you want to understand *how* the agent solved the problem, scroll up through the OpenTools log and follow the numbered reasoning cycles and memory updates."

Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\\nComments:\\n89 pages, 18 figures.

Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\\nComments:\\n89 pages, 18 figures.

Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\\nComments:\\n89 pages, 18 figures.

            "- **Prompt Specificity**: Crafting a specific prompt for the Visual_AI_Tool will enhance the accuracy of the analysis. For example, a prompt could be: \"What color is the dog, what breed is it, and what is it lying next to?\"\n",
            "- **Processing Time**: Be aware that the analysis may take some time, especially if the image is complex or if the tool is processing multiple queries simultaneously.\n",

Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\\\",\\n    \\\"published\\\": \\\"2025-02-16T21:18:47+00:00\\\",\\n    \\\"updated\\\": \\\"2025-02-16T21:18:47+00:00\\\",\\n    \\\"categories\\\": [\\n      \\\"cs.LG\\\",\\n      \\\"cs.CL\\\",\\n      \\\"cs.CV\\\",\\n      \\\"cs.MA\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"primary_category\\\": \\\"cs.LG\\\",\\n    \\\"pdf_url\\\": \\\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11271v1\\\",\\n    \\\"doi\\\": null,\\n    \\\"journal_ref\\\": null,\\n    \\\"comment\\\": \\\"89 pages, 18 figures.

OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools\\' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools.

Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools\\' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\",\\n    \"published\": \"2025-02-16T21:18:47+00:00\",\\n    \"updated\": \"2025-02-16T21:18:47+00:00\",\\n    \"categories\": [\\n      \"cs.LG\",\\n      \"cs.CL\",\\n      \"cs.CV\",\\n      \"cs.MA\"\\n    ],\\n    \"primary_category\": \"cs.LG\",\\n    \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11271v1\",\\n    \"doi\": null,\\n    \"journal_ref\": null,\\n    \"comment\": \"89 pages, 18 figures.

numerical calculation, and multi-step reasoning. Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\\nComments:\\n89 pages, 18 figures.

Given a user query $q \\\\in\\n              \\\\mathcal{Q}$ and a pretrained language model $\\\\text{LLM}_\\\\theta(\\\\cdot)$, a naive approach would generate\\n              an output directly as $y \\\\sim \\\\text{LLM}_\\\\theta(q)$, providing a single-step response. In contrast, our\\nOcto\\nTools\\nframework introduces a\\nstructured\\n,\\nmulti-step\\nprocess that leverages\\nexternal tools\\nto tackle queries effectively.\\nSpecifically,\\nOcto\\nTools\\ncontains a set of\\ntools\\n$\\\\mathcal{D}\\n              = \\\\{d_i\\\\}_{i=1}^n$ and associated metadata $\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\{m_i\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $n$ is the number of\\n              available tools. Given a query, a\\nplanner\\n(based on a language model) first generates a\\ntentative plan\\nfrom a high-level perspective, indicating how these tools can be used to address the\\n              query, which forms the initial\\ncontext\\n$s_0$. From this plan, the planner determines the initial\\naction\\n$a_1$ for tool usage, specifying which tool $d_1$ to use, the relevant context, and a\\n              sub-goal. An\\nexecutor\\n(also powered by a language model) then converts the planner's text-based\\n              action $a_1$ into a machine-executable\\ncommand\\n$o_t$, which is run to obtain intermediate results\\n              $r_1$. These results, along with the original action, update the context to $s_1 := (a_1, o_1, r_1)$. This\\n              process constitutes one step in our framework.\\nThis process repeats, with the planner iteratively refining its actions based on the evolving context\\n              until it either finds a complete solution or inference limits (e.g., time or steps) are reached. After $T$\\n              steps, the framework produces a full\\ntrajectory\\n$(s_0, s_1, \\\\dots, s_T)$, which is stored in a\\n              structured manner in the context. The planner then uses this trajectory to generate the\\nfinal\\n                solution\\nto the original query.\\nTo sum up,\\nOcto\\nTools\\nprovides a robust and effective framework\\n              for solving complex tasks through sub-goal decomposition and systematical tool usage. Standardized\\ntool\\n                cards\\nencapsulate functionality , the\\nplanner\\norchestrates both high-level and low-level task\\n              planning, and the\\nexecutor\\ninstantiates tool calls for each sub-goal.\\nTask-Specific Tool Selection\\nThe\\nOcto\\nTools\\ntoolbox contains a diverse set of tools\\n              covering different modalities and skills. By leveraging structured tool cards and robust planning\\n              capabilities,\\nOcto\\nTools\\ndemonstrates strong generality when all\\n              available tools are enabled across different tasks. However, when a small set of validation examples are\\n              available for a task, configuring a\\ntask-specific subset of tools\\ncan further enhance efficiency\\n              and effectiveness.\\nTo this end, we propose an automated algorithm to optimize the toolset configuration for each task. Given\\n              $n$ available tools in the toolbox, the total number of possible subsets is $O(2^n)$, which is\\n              prohibitively large. To make this tractable, we employ a greedy search strategy that reduces the\\n              complexity to $O(n)$. Our approach proceeds in three stages.\\nExperimental Results\\nMain Results: Comparison with Baselines\\nTo demonstrate the generality of our\\nOcto\\nTools\\nframework, we conduct comprehensive\\n              evaluations on\\n16 diverse benchmarks\\nspanning\\ntwo modalities\\n,\\nfive domains\\n, and\\nfour reasoning types\\n. These benchmarks encompass a wide range of complex reasoning tasks, including\\nvisual understanding\\n,\\nnumerical calculation\\n,\\nknowledge retrieval\\n, and\\nmulti-step\\n                reasoning\\n.\\nPerformance gains across different benchmarks from our\\nOcto\\nTools\\nframework over the base GPT-4o model.\\nComparison with other agent frameworks using the same underlying toolbox.\\nOcto\\nTools\\nachieves superior performance with an\\n                    average accuracy of 58.5%, outperforming the next best baseline by 7.3%.
