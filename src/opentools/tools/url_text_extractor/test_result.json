    "expected_answer": "Tags used in HTML\nHTML Tags\nThis is a list of tags used in the\nHTML\nlanguage.  Each tag starts\nwith a tag opener (a less than sign) and ends with a tag closer (a\ngreater than sign).   Many tags have corresponding closing tags which\nidentical except for a slash after the tag opener. (For example, the\nTITLE\ntag).\nSome tags take parameters, called attributes. The attributes are given\nafter the tag, separated by spaces. Certain attributes have an effect\nsimply by their presence, others are followed by an equals sign and\na value. (See the\nAnchor\ntag, for example). The names of tags and\nattributes are not case sensitive: they may be in lower, upper, or\nmixed case with exactly the same meaning.  (In this document they\nare generally represented in upper case.)\nCurrently HTML documents are transmitted without the normal SGML framing\ntags, but if these are included parsers will ignore them.\nTitle\nThe title of a document is given between title tags:\n...\nThe text between the opening and the closing tags is a title for the\nhypertext node. There should only be one title in any node. It should\nidentify the content of the node in a fairly wide context, and should\nideally fit on one line.\nThe title is not strictly part of the text of the document, but is\nan attribute of the node. It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks,\nor highlighting. the title may be used to identify the node in a history\nlist, to label the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally\ndisplayed in the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with\nheadings\n.\nNext ID\nObsolete: NeXT Browser only.  May be ignored. This tag takes a  single\nattribute which is the number of the next document-wide numeric identifier\nto be allocated (not good SGML). Note that when modifying a document,\nold anchor ids should not be reused, as there may be references stored\nelsewhere which point to them.  This is read and generated by hypertext\neditors. Human writers of HTML usually use mnemonic alpha identifiers.\nBrowser software may ignore this tag. Example of use:\nBase Address\nAnchors\nspecify addresses of other documents, in a from relative to\nthe address of the current document. Normally, the address of a document\nis known to the browser because it was used to access the document.\nHowever, is a document is mailed, or is somehow visible with more\nthan one address (for example, via its filename and also via its library\nname server catalogue number), then the browser needs to know the\nbase address in order to correctly deduce external document addresses.\nThe format of this tag is not yet specified. NOT CURRENTLY USED\nAnchors\nThe format of an anchor is as follows:\n...\nThe text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either the\nstart or destination (or both) of a link. Attributes of the anchor\ntag are as follows.\nHREF\nIf the HREF attribute is present, the anchor is senstive text:\nthe start of a link. If the reader selects this text,  he should be\npresented with another document whose network address is defined by\nthe value of the HREF attribute . The format of the network address\nis specified\nelsewhere\n. This allows for the form HREF=#identifier\nto refer to another anchor in the same document. If the anchor is\nin another document, the atribute is a\nrelative name\n, relative to\nthe documents address (or specified\nbase address\nif any).\nNAME\nThe attribute NAME allows the anchor to be the destination of\na link. The value of the parameter is that part of a hypertext address\nwhich follows the\nhash sign\n.\nTYPE\nAn attribute TYPE may give the relationship described by the\nhyertext link. The type is expressed by a string for extensibility.\nStrings for types with particular semantics will be registered by\nthe W3 team. The default relationship if none other is given is void.\nAll attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is necessary\nfor the anchor to be useful.\nIsIndex\nThis tag informs the reader that the document is an index document.\nAs well as reading it, the reader may use a keyword search.\nFormat:\nThe node may be queried with a keyword search by suffixing the node\naddress with a question mark, followed by a list of keywords separated\nby plus signs. See the\nnetwork address format\n.\nPlaintext\nThis tag indicates that all following text is to be taken litterally,\nup to the end of the file.  Plain text is designed to be represented\nin the same way as example XMP text, with fixed width character and\nsignificant line breaks. Format:\nThis tag allows the rest of a file to be read efficiently without\nparsing. Its presence is an optimisation. There is no closing tag.\nExample sections\nThese styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded absolutely\nas is into the document. The format is:\n...\nThe text between these tags is to be portrayed in a fixed width font,\nso that any formatting done by character spacing on successive lines\nwill be maintained. Between the opening and closing tags:\nThe text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters, including\nthe tag opener, so long as it does not contain the closing tag in\nfull.\nLine boundaries are significant, and are to be interpreted as a move\nto the start of a new line.\nThe ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character should be interpreted as the\nsmallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number\nof characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not\nrecommended however.\nThe LISTING tag is portrayed so that at least 132 characters will\nfit on a line.  The XMP tag is portrayed in a font so that at least\n80 characters will fit on a line but is otherwise identical to LISTING.\nThe examples of markup are here given using the XMP tag.\nParagraph\nThis tag indicates a new paragraph. The exact representation of this\n(indentation,  leading, etc) is not defined here, and may be a function\nof other tags, style sheets etc. The format is simply\n(In SGML terms, paragraph elements are transmitted in minimised form).\nHeadings\nSeveral levels (at least six) of heading are supported. Note that\na hypertext document tends to need less levels of  heading than a\nnormal document whose only structure is given by the nesting of headings.\nH1 is the highest level of heading, and is recommened for the start\nof a hypertext node.   It is suggested that the first heading be one\nsuitable for a reader who is already browsing in related information,\nin contrast to the\ntitle\ntag which should identify the node in a wider\ncontext.\n,\n        ,\n        ,\n        ,\n        ,\nThese tags are kept as defined in the CERN SGML guide. Their definition\nis completely historical, deriving from the\nAAP\ntag set.  A difference\nis that HTML documents allow headings to be terminated by  closing\ntags:\nSecond level heading\nAddress\nThis tag is for address information, signatures, etc, normally at\nthe top or bottom of a document. typically, it is italic and/or right\njustified or indented. The  format is:\ntext ...\nHighlighting\nThe highlighted phrase tags may occur in normal text, and may be nested.\nFor each opening tag there must follow a corresponding closing tag.\nNOT CURRENTLY USED.\n...\n...\netc.\nGlossaries\nA glosary (or definition list) is a list of paragraphs each of which\nhas a short title alongside it.  Apart from glossaries, this format\nis useful for presenting a set of named elements to the reader. The\nformat is as follows:\nTerm\ndefinition pagagraph\nTerm2\nDefinition of term2\nLists\nA list is a sequence of paragraphs, each of which is preceded by a\nspecial mark or sequence number. The format is:\nlist element\nanother list element ...\nThe opening list tag  must be immediately followed by the first list\nelement. The representation of the list is not defined here, but a\nbulleted list for unordered lists,  and a  sequence of numbered paragraphs\nfor an ordered list would be quite appropriate.  Other possibilities\nfor interactive display include embedded scrollable browse panels.\nOpening list tags are:\nUL\nA list multi-line paragraphs, typically separated by some white\nspace.\nMENU\nA list of smaller paragraphs. Typically one line per item, with\na style more compact than UL.\nDIR\nA list of short elements, less than one line. Typical style is\nto arrange in four columns or provide a browser, etc.\nthe closing tag must obviously match the opening tag.",

Many tags have corresponding closing tags which\nidentical except for a slash after the tag opener. (For example, the\nTITLE\ntag).\nSome tags take parameters, called attributes. The attributes are given\nafter the tag, separated by spaces. Certain attributes have an effect\nsimply by their presence, others are followed by an equals sign and\na value. (See the\nAnchor\ntag, for example). The names of tags and\nattributes are not case sensitive: they may be in lower, upper, or\nmixed case with exactly the same meaning.  (In this document they\nare generally represented in upper case.)\nCurrently HTML documents are transmitted without the normal SGML framing\ntags, but if these are included parsers will ignore them.\nTitle\nThe title of a document is given between title tags:\n...\nThe text between the opening and the closing tags is a title for the\nhypertext node. There should only be one title in any node. It should\nidentify the content of the node in a fairly wide context, and should\nideally fit on one line.\nThe title is not strictly part of the text of the document, but is\nan attribute of the node. It may not contain anchors, paragraph marks,\nor highlighting. the title may be used to identify the node in a history\nlist, to label the window displaying the node, etc. It is not normally\ndisplayed in the text of a document itself. Contrast titles with\nheadings\n.\nNext ID\nObsolete: NeXT Browser only.  May be ignored. This tag takes a  single\nattribute which is the number of the next document-wide numeric identifier\nto be allocated (not good SGML). Note that when modifying a document,\nold anchor ids should not be reused, as there may be references stored\nelsewhere which point to them.  This is read and generated by hypertext\neditors. Human writers of HTML usually use mnemonic alpha identifiers.\nBrowser software may ignore this tag. Example of use:\nBase Address\nAnchors\nspecify addresses of other documents, in a from relative to\nthe address of the current document. Normally, the address of a document\nis known to the browser because it was used to access the document.\nHowever, is a document is mailed, or is somehow visible with more\nthan one address (for example, via its filename and also via its library\nname server catalogue number), then the browser needs to know the\nbase address in order to correctly deduce external document addresses.\nThe format of this tag is not yet specified. NOT CURRENTLY USED\nAnchors\nThe format of an anchor is as follows:\n...\nThe text between the opening tag and the closing tag is either the\nstart or destination (or both) of a link. Attributes of the anchor\ntag are as follows.\nHREF\nIf the HREF attribute is present, the anchor is senstive text:\nthe start of a link. If the reader selects this text,  he should be\npresented with another document whose network address is defined by\nthe value of the HREF attribute . The format of the network address\nis specified\nelsewhere\n. This allows for the form HREF=#identifier\nto refer to another anchor in the same document. If the anchor is\nin another document, the atribute is a\nrelative name\n, relative to\nthe documents address (or specified\nbase address\nif any).\nNAME\nThe attribute NAME allows the anchor to be the destination of\na link. The value of the parameter is that part of a hypertext address\nwhich follows the\nhash sign\n.\nTYPE\nAn attribute TYPE may give the relationship described by the\nhyertext link. The type is expressed by a string for extensibility.\nStrings for types with particular semantics will be registered by\nthe W3 team. The default relationship if none other is given is void.\nAll attributes are optional, although one of NAME and HREF is necessary\nfor the anchor to be useful.\nIsIndex\nThis tag informs the reader that the document is an index document.\nAs well as reading it, the reader may use a keyword search.\nFormat:\nThe node may be queried with a keyword search by suffixing the node\naddress with a question mark, followed by a list of keywords separated\nby plus signs. See the\nnetwork address format\n.\nPlaintext\nThis tag indicates that all following text is to be taken litterally,\nup to the end of the file.  Plain text is designed to be represented\nin the same way as example XMP text, with fixed width character and\nsignificant line breaks. Format:\nThis tag allows the rest of a file to be read efficiently without\nparsing. Its presence is an optimisation. There is no closing tag.\nExample sections\nThese styles allow text of fixed-width characters to be embedded absolutely\nas is into the document. The format is:\n...\nThe text between these tags is to be portrayed in a fixed width font,\nso that any formatting done by character spacing on successive lines\nwill be maintained. Between the opening and closing tags:\nThe text may contain any ISO Latin printable characters, including\nthe tag opener, so long as it does not contain the closing tag in\nfull.\nLine boundaries are significant, and are to be interpreted as a move\nto the start of a new line.\nThe ASCII Horizontal Tab (HT) character should be interpreted as the\nsmallest positive nonzero number of spaces which will leave the number\nof characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its use is not\nrecommended however.\nThe LISTING tag is portrayed so that at least 132 characters will\nfit on a line.  The XMP tag is portrayed in a font so that at least\n80 characters will fit on a line but is otherwise identical to LISTING.\nThe examples of markup are here given using the XMP tag.\nParagraph\nThis tag indicates a new paragraph. The exact representation of this\n(indentation,  leading, etc) is not defined here, and may be a function\nof other tags, style sheets etc. The format is simply\n(In SGML terms, paragraph elements are transmitted in minimised form).\nHeadings\nSeveral levels (at least six) of heading are supported. Note that\na hypertext document tends to need less levels of  heading than a\nnormal document whose only structure is given by the nesting of headings.\nH1 is the highest level of heading, and is recommened for the start\nof a hypertext node.

It  has the idea of roles: member, moderator, group owner\n and system manager.\n\n\n Jill\n\n =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n Asynchronous  Computer  Conferencing Working Document ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC\n 18/WG 4 Version 8, June 1991, Printed 22/8/91:4:51 pm\n\n CCITT Study Group VII/Q.18\n\n SOURCE:  Joint  ISO/IEC/CCITT  Group  Communication  Subgroup  at  the\n co-located meeting of CCITT Study Group I/Q.15, VII/Q.18  and  ISO/IEC\n JTC 1/SC 18/WG 4 SPW Messaging\n\n\n Part 1: Introduction    iv\n 1       Overview        1\n 2       Scope and Field of Application  1\n 3       References      1\n 4       Definitions     2\n 5       Abbreviations   2\n 6       Conventions     3\n 7       Part   2:   Asynchronous  Computer  Conferencing  Model  and\n         Abstract Service 3\n 7.1     Introduction    3\n 7.2     Asynchronous Computer Conferencing Terminology  4\n 7.3     Asynchronous Conferencing Abstract Service Definition   7\n 7.3.1   Ports and Operations      7\n 7.3.2   Member port       8\n 7.3.3   Moderator port    12\n 7.3.4   Conference Management Port        12\n 7.3.5   Possible extensions       13\n 7.3.6   Notification handling   13\n 7.3.7   Issues for further study:       14\n 8       Part 3: Distributed realisation of the computer conferencing model\n    15\n 8.1     Partitioning    15\n 8.2     Operational procedure   15\n 8.3     Navigation      16\n 8.4     Execution       16\n 8.5     Communication between CCSA-s    17\n 8.6     Distribution of new contributions       18\n 8.7     Varying real implementations    19\n 8.8     Mapping CCAP operations on distributed operations       21\n 8.9     For further study       23\n Annex A: Glossary of Terms      23\n Annex B: Security Overview      24\n 1       Introduction    25\n 2       Vulnerabilities 25\n 3       Vulnerability analysis  25\n 4       Security services       25\n\n 1    Overview\n\n      Part  2  of  this document presents a basic asynchronous computer\n      conferencing application.\n\n      Part  3  describes  a  possible  distributed  realisation  of the\n      computer conferencing application.\n\n 2    Scope and Field of Application\n\n      This  Recommendation  defines  the  overall system and service of\n      Asynchronous Computer Conferencing.

Given the exact same input twice, the hash function\nshould always produce the same output.  Even a single bit changed in\nthe input, though, should produce a different hash value.\nThe hash value should be small enough to\nbe manageable in further manipulations,\nyet large enough to prevent an attacker from\nrandomly finding a block of data that produces the same hash.\nMD5, documented in\nRFC 1321,\nis perhaps the most widely used hash function at this time (2001).\nIt takes an arbitrarily sized block of data as input and produces\na 128-bit (16-byte) hash.  It uses bitwise operations, addition,\nand a table of values based on the sine function to process\nthe data in 64-byte blocks.\nRFC 1810\ndiscusses the performance of MD5, and presents some speed measurements\nfor various architectures.\nThe other major hash function is NIST's Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA),\nspecified in\nFIPS PUB 180-1\n.\nIt is similar to MD5 in that it does various bit shuffling to process\nthe input data in blocks.  SHA's output is a 160-bit hash.\nHash functions can't be used directly for encryption, but are very useful\nfor authentication.  One of the simplest uses of a hash function\nis to protect passwords.  UNIX systems, in particular, will\napply a hash function to a user's password and store the hash\nvalue, not the password itself.  To authenticate the user, a password\nis requested, and the response run through the hash function.  If\nthe resulting hash value is the same as the one stored, then the\nuser must have supplied the correct password, and is authenticated.\nSince the hash function is irreversible, obtaining the hash values\ndoesn't reveal the passwords to an attacker.

To automate the process,\ncertificates\nare used, which allow highly trusted keys to authenticate\nothers.\nA certificate\nis a cryptographically sealed data object that includes the\nserver's identity and public key.

If even one bit is changed\nin the certificate, the hash value changes, and the signature\nbecomes invalid.  If the client already possesses\nthe issuer's public key, and trusts the issuer to verify\nthe identity of the server, then the client can be sure\nthat the public key in the certificate is the public key\nof the server.\nCertificates are a form of key chaining, but are used for authentication\nkeys, not encryption keys.\nAn interloper would have know either\nthe private key of the server or the private key of the\nissuer to successfully impersonate the server.\nAs it turns out, only a handful of issuers, termed\ncertificate authorities\n(CAs), are needed.  For\nexample,\nVeriSign\n, the\nmajor U.S. issuer, issues certificates only after a background\ncheck insures both the identity of the subject, and their\nauthority over a particular DNS name.  VeriSign's public keys\nare hardwired into both Netscape's and Microsoft's web browsers,\nso a web server with a VeriSign-signed certificate can be authenticated by a\nbrowser with no additional information.  If the server presents\na certificate not signed by VeriSign (or another recognized authority),\nor if the DNS name of the server doesn't match the DNS name in\nthe certificate, a warning message is displayed, and the user\nmay decide how to proceed.\nX.509 Certificates\nThe most common type of certificate is an X.509 certificate, an\nASN.1\nencoded block of data specified\nin ISO Standard X.509.\nAs an example of an X.509 certificate,\nhere's a decode (generated with\nopenssl\n)\nof one of\nwww.freesoft.org\n's old certificates; the\nactual certificate is about 1KB in size.  It was issued (signed)\nby\nThawte\n(since acquired by\nVerisign\n),\nas stated in its Issuer field.\nIt's subject (me)\ncontains a lot of personal information, but the most important part\nis the common name (CN) of\nwww.freesoft.org\n- this is the part\nthat must match the host being authenticated.  Next comes an RSA public\nkey (modulus and public exponent), followed by the signature, computed\nby taking an MD5 hash of the rest of the certificate and encrypting\nit with Thawte's RSA private key.\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 1 (0x0)\n        Serial Number: 7829 (0x1e95)\n        Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                OU=Certification Services Division,\n                CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Jul  9 16:04:02 1998 GMT\n            Not After : Jul  9 16:04:02 1999 GMT\n        Subject: C=US, ST=Maryland, L=Pasadena, O=Brent Baccala,\n                 OU=FreeSoft, CN=www.freesoft.org/Email=baccala@freesoft.org\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n            RSA Public Key: (1024 bit)\n                Modulus (1024 bit):\n                    00:b4:31:98:0a:c4:bc:62:c1:88:aa:dc:b0:c8:bb:\n                    33:35:19:d5:0c:64:b9:3d:41:b2:96:fc:f3:31:e1:\n                    66:36:d0:8e:56:12:44:ba:75:eb:e8:1c:9c:5b:66:\n                    70:33:52:14:c9:ec:4f:91:51:70:39:de:53:85:17:\n                    16:94:6e:ee:f4:d5:6f:d5:ca:b3:47:5e:1b:0c:7b:\n                    c5:cc:2b:6b:c1:90:c3:16:31:0d:bf:7a:c7:47:77:\n                    8f:a0:21:c7:4c:d0:16:65:00:c1:0f:d7:b8:80:e3:\n                    d2:75:6b:c1:ea:9e:5c:5c:ea:7d:c1:a1:10:bc:b8:\n                    e8:35:1c:9e:27:52:7e:41:8f\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n    Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        93:5f:8f:5f:c5:af:bf:0a:ab:a5:6d:fb:24:5f:b6:59:5d:9d:\n        92:2e:4a:1b:8b:ac:7d:99:17:5d:cd:19:f6:ad:ef:63:2f:92:\n        ab:2f:4b:cf:0a:13:90:ee:2c:0e:43:03:be:f6:ea:8e:9c:67:\n        d0:a2:40:03:f7:ef:6a:15:09:79:a9:46:ed:b7:16:1b:41:72:\n        0d:19:aa:ad:dd:9a:df:ab:97:50:65:f5:5e:85:a6:ef:19:d1:\n        5a:de:9d:ea:63:cd:cb:cc:6d:5d:01:85:b5:6d:c8:f3:d9:f7:\n        8f:0e:fc:ba:1f:34:e9:96:6e:6c:cf:f2:ef:9b:bf:de:b5:22:\n        68:9f\nTo validate this certificate, we need another certificate, one\nthat matches the Issuer (Thawte Server CA) in the first certificate.\nThen we take the RSA public key from the second (CA) certificate,\nuse it to decode the signature on the first certificate to\nobtain an MD5 hash, which must match an actual MD5 hash\ncomputed over the rest of the certificate.\nHere's the CA cert:\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 3 (0x2)\n        Serial Number: 1 (0x1)\n        Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                OU=Certification Services Division,\n                CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Aug  1 00:00:00 1996 GMT\n            Not After : Dec 31 23:59:59 2020 GMT\n        Subject: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                 OU=Certification Services Division,\n                 CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n            RSA Public Key: (1024 bit)\n                Modulus (1024 bit):\n                    00:d3:a4:50:6e:c8:ff:56:6b:e6:cf:5d:b6:ea:0c:\n                    68:75:47:a2:aa:c2:da:84:25:fc:a8:f4:47:51:da:\n                    85:b5:20:74:94:86:1e:0f:75:c9:e9:08:61:f5:06:\n                    6d:30:6e:15:19:02:e9:52:c0:62:db:4d:99:9e:e2:\n                    6a:0c:44:38:cd:fe:be:e3:64:09:70:c5:fe:b1:6b:\n                    29:b6:2f:49:c8:3b:d4:27:04:25:10:97:2f:e7:90:\n                    6d:c0:28:42:99:d7:4c:43:de:c3:f5:21:6d:54:9f:\n                    5d:c3:58:e1:c0:e4:d9:5b:b0:b8:dc:b4:7b:df:36:\n                    3a:c2:b5:66:22:12:d6:87:0d\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n        X509v3 extensions:\n            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical\n                CA:TRUE\n    Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        07:fa:4c:69:5c:fb:95:cc:46:ee:85:83:4d:21:30:8e:ca:d9:\n        a8:6f:49:1a:e6:da:51:e3:60:70:6c:84:61:11:a1:1a:c8:48:\n        3e:59:43:7d:4f:95:3d:a1:8b:b7:0b:62:98:7a:75:8a:dd:88:\n        4e:4e:9e:40:db:a8:cc:32:74:b9:6f:0d:c6:e3:b3:44:0b:d9:\n        8a:6f:9a:29:9b:99:18:28:3b:d1:e3:40:28:9a:5a:3c:d5:b5:\n        e7:20:1b:8b:ca:a4:ab:8d:e9:51:d9:e2:4c:2c:59:a9:da:b9:\n        b2:75:1b:f6:42:f2:ef:c7:f2:18:f9:89:bc:a3:ff:8a:23:2e:\n        70:47\nThis is an example of a\nself-signed\ncertificate; note that\nthe issuer and subject are the same.  There's no way to verify this\ncertificate except by checking it against itself; we've reached\nthe top of the certificate chain.  So how does this certificate\nbecome trusted?  Simple - it's manually configured.  Thawte is\none of roughly a dozen certificate authorities recognized by\nboth Microsoft and Netscape.  This certificate came with your\nweb browser (you can find it listed in the security settings);\nit's trusted by default.  As a long-lived (note\nthe expiration date), globally trusted certificate that can sign\npretty much anything (note the lack of any constraints), it's\nmatching private key has to be one of the most closely guarded\nin the world.\nWhat would happen if the private key matching the Freesoft\ncertificate was stolen?  The certificate would have to be\nrevoked\n.  Certificate Authorities maintain\nCertificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) indicating which\ncertificates have been revoked before their natural lifespan\nwould expire.\nPGP Certificates\nPGP defines (in\nRFC 2440\n)\nits own certificate format.  PGP certificates are used primarily\nto implement the PGP Web of Trust, a \ncertification system far more decentralized than X.509.\nThe Web of Trust defines trust relationships based on personal\ncertification by known and trusted individuals.  To participate\nin the Web of Trust, you need to find someone already trusted\nto certify you.\n\\begin{soapbox}\nOther than it's far more decentralized nature, the PGP\nWeb of Trust is actual quite similar to the X.509 system.\nThough neither the PGP nor the X.509 certificate design\nis completely satisfactory,\nin fact most PGP certificates could be converted into\nparallel X.509 certificates, and the entire Web of Trust\nreproduced using X.509 syntax.  Likewise, X.509 certificates\ncould implement a Web of Trust.  Using off-the-shelf tools like\nopenssl\n, I could create\na Freesoft Certificate Authority, have it authenticated by\nother, well-known websites, and in turn authenticate other sites.\nYet the X.509 system has been adopted by corporate America,\nand it shows.  The average X.509 certificate expires in a year\nor two and costs at least $100.\nRenewals typically cost almost as much as the original.\nThat's just for a server\ncertificate, that can't be used to sign other certificates.\nChaining certificates, that can sign other certificates,\ncost thousands of dollars, though there are some real\ntechnical issues here that need to be resolved before\nchaining certificates can be more widely used.\nA solution may be on the horizon in the form of secure DNS.\nA DNS resource record type (CERT) has been defined\n(\nRFC 2538\n)\nto carry X.509 or PGP certificates.\nProgress is being made (see\nRFC 3130\n)\ntowards cryptographically securing DNS, so within a few years\nwe may see signed DNS domains that can carry CERT records.\nIn my opinion, this would make a lot more sense than the present\nscheme... if corporate America moves to adopt it.\n\\end{soapbox}\nNext:\nDatagrams and Streams\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nCertificates",

Next comes an RSA public\nkey (modulus and public exponent), followed by the signature, computed\nby taking an MD5 hash of the rest of the certificate and encrypting\nit with Thawte's RSA private key.\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 1 (0x0)\n        Serial Number: 7829 (0x1e95)\n        Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                OU=Certification Services Division,\n                CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Jul  9 16:04:02 1998 GMT\n            Not After : Jul  9 16:04:02 1999 GMT\n        Subject: C=US, ST=Maryland, L=Pasadena, O=Brent Baccala,\n                 OU=FreeSoft, CN=www.freesoft.org/Email=baccala@freesoft.org\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n            RSA Public Key: (1024 bit)\n                Modulus (1024 bit):\n                    00:b4:31:98:0a:c4:bc:62:c1:88:aa:dc:b0:c8:bb:\n                    33:35:19:d5:0c:64:b9:3d:41:b2:96:fc:f3:31:e1:\n                    66:36:d0:8e:56:12:44:ba:75:eb:e8:1c:9c:5b:66:\n                    70:33:52:14:c9:ec:4f:91:51:70:39:de:53:85:17:\n                    16:94:6e:ee:f4:d5:6f:d5:ca:b3:47:5e:1b:0c:7b:\n                    c5:cc:2b:6b:c1:90:c3:16:31:0d:bf:7a:c7:47:77:\n                    8f:a0:21:c7:4c:d0:16:65:00:c1:0f:d7:b8:80:e3:\n                    d2:75:6b:c1:ea:9e:5c:5c:ea:7d:c1:a1:10:bc:b8:\n                    e8:35:1c:9e:27:52:7e:41:8f\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n    Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        93:5f:8f:5f:c5:af:bf:0a:ab:a5:6d:fb:24:5f:b6:59:5d:9d:\n        92:2e:4a:1b:8b:ac:7d:99:17:5d:cd:19:f6:ad:ef:63:2f:92:\n        ab:2f:4b:cf:0a:13:90:ee:2c:0e:43:03:be:f6:ea:8e:9c:67:\n        d0:a2:40:03:f7:ef:6a:15:09:79:a9:46:ed:b7:16:1b:41:72:\n        0d:19:aa:ad:dd:9a:df:ab:97:50:65:f5:5e:85:a6:ef:19:d1:\n        5a:de:9d:ea:63:cd:cb:cc:6d:5d:01:85:b5:6d:c8:f3:d9:f7:\n        8f:0e:fc:ba:1f:34:e9:96:6e:6c:cf:f2:ef:9b:bf:de:b5:22:\n        68:9f\nTo validate this certificate, we need another certificate, one\nthat matches the Issuer (Thawte Server CA) in the first certificate.\nThen we take the RSA public key from the second (CA) certificate,\nuse it to decode the signature on the first certificate to\nobtain an MD5 hash, which must match an actual MD5 hash\ncomputed over the rest of the certificate.\nHere's the CA cert:\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 3 (0x2)\n        Serial Number: 1 (0x1)\n        Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                OU=Certification Services Division,\n                CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Aug  1 00:00:00 1996 GMT\n            Not After : Dec 31 23:59:59 2020 GMT\n        Subject: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                 OU=Certification Services Division,\n                 CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n            RSA Public Key: (1024 bit)\n                Modulus (1024 bit):\n                    00:d3:a4:50:6e:c8:ff:56:6b:e6:cf:5d:b6:ea:0c:\n                    68:75:47:a2:aa:c2:da:84:25:fc:a8:f4:47:51:da:\n                    85:b5:20:74:94:86:1e:0f:75:c9:e9:08:61:f5:06:\n                    6d:30:6e:15:19:02:e9:52:c0:62:db:4d:99:9e:e2:\n                    6a:0c:44:38:cd:fe:be:e3:64:09:70:c5:fe:b1:6b:\n                    29:b6:2f:49:c8:3b:d4:27:04:25:10:97:2f:e7:90:\n                    6d:c0:28:42:99:d7:4c:43:de:c3:f5:21:6d:54:9f:\n                    5d:c3:58:e1:c0:e4:d9:5b:b0:b8:dc:b4:7b:df:36:\n                    3a:c2:b5:66:22:12:d6:87:0d\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n        X509v3 extensions:\n            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical\n                CA:TRUE\n    Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        07:fa:4c:69:5c:fb:95:cc:46:ee:85:83:4d:21:30:8e:ca:d9:\n        a8:6f:49:1a:e6:da:51:e3:60:70:6c:84:61:11:a1:1a:c8:48:\n        3e:59:43:7d:4f:95:3d:a1:8b:b7:0b:62:98:7a:75:8a:dd:88:\n        4e:4e:9e:40:db:a8:cc:32:74:b9:6f:0d:c6:e3:b3:44:0b:d9:\n        8a:6f:9a:29:9b:99:18:28:3b:d1:e3:40:28:9a:5a:3c:d5:b5:\n        e7:20:1b:8b:ca:a4:ab:8d:e9:51:d9:e2:4c:2c:59:a9:da:b9:\n        b2:75:1b:f6:42:f2:ef:c7:f2:18:f9:89:bc:a3:ff:8a:23:2e:\n        70:47\nThis is an example of a\nself-signed\ncertificate; note that\nthe issuer and subject are the same.  There's no way to verify this\ncertificate except by checking it against itself; we've reached\nthe top of the certificate chain.  So how does this certificate\nbecome trusted?  Simple - it's manually configured.  Thawte is\none of roughly a dozen certificate authorities recognized by\nboth Microsoft and Netscape.  This certificate came with your\nweb browser (you can find it listed in the security settings);\nit's trusted by default.  As a long-lived (note\nthe expiration date), globally trusted certificate that can sign\npretty much anything (note the lack of any constraints), it's\nmatching private key has to be one of the most closely guarded\nin the world.\nWhat would happen if the private key matching the Freesoft\ncertificate was stolen?  The certificate would have to be\nrevoked\n.  Certificate Authorities maintain\nCertificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) indicating which\ncertificates have been revoked before their natural lifespan\nwould expire.\nPGP Certificates\nPGP defines (in\nRFC 2440\n)\nits own certificate format.  PGP certificates are used primarily\nto implement the PGP Web of Trust, a \ncertification system far more decentralized than X.509.\nThe Web of Trust defines trust relationships based on personal\ncertification by known and trusted individuals.  To participate\nin the Web of Trust, you need to find someone already trusted\nto certify you.\n\\begin{soapbox}\nOther than it's far more decentralized nature, the PGP\nWeb of Trust is actual quite similar to the X.509 system.\nThough neither the PGP nor the X.509 certificate design\nis completely satisfactory,\nin fact most PGP certificates could be converted into\nparallel X.509 certificates, and the entire Web of Trust\nreproduced using X.509 syntax.  Likewise, X.509 certificates\ncould implement a Web of Trust.  Using off-the-shelf tools like\nopenssl\n, I could create\na Freesoft Certificate Authority, have it authenticated by\nother, well-known websites, and in turn authenticate other sites.\nYet the X.509 system has been adopted by corporate America,\nand it shows.  The average X.509 certificate expires in a year\nor two and costs at least $100.\nRenewals typically cost almost as much as the original.\nThat's just for a server\ncertificate, that can't be used to sign other certificates.\nChaining certificates, that can sign other certificates,\ncost thousands of dollars, though there are some real\ntechnical issues here that need to be resolved before\nchaining certificates can be more widely used.\nA solution may be on the horizon in the form of secure DNS.\nA DNS resource record type (CERT) has been defined\n(\nRFC 2538\n)\nto carry X.509 or PGP certificates.\nProgress is being made (see\nRFC 3130\n)\ntowards cryptographically securing DNS, so within a few years\nwe may see signed DNS domains that can carry CERT records.\nIn my opinion, this would make a lot more sense than the present\nscheme... if corporate America moves to adopt it.\n\\end{soapbox}\nNext:\nDatagrams and Streams\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nCertificates",

If if another machine could intercept all\nthe messages, it could not impersonate the web server without\na copy of the private key.\nWhich raises the question of how the public key becomes known and trusted,\nsince if the public key could be switched with another,\nthe entire scheme would be defeated.\nAn attacker could simply generate his own public/private key pair,\nthen disseminate the public key under the false pretense of\nit belonging to the server being compromised.\nOne solution is to manually set which keys authenticate which\nservers, but for applications\nto scale up to Internet proportions, manual configuration\nis clearly inadequate.  To automate the process,\ncertificates\nare used, which allow highly trusted keys to authenticate\nothers.\nA certificate\nis a cryptographically sealed data object that includes the\nserver's identity and public key.  The certificate is signed\nby computing its hash value and encrypting this with an\nissuer\n's private key.  If even one bit is changed\nin the certificate, the hash value changes, and the signature\nbecomes invalid.  If the client already possesses\nthe issuer's public key, and trusts the issuer to verify\nthe identity of the server, then the client can be sure\nthat the public key in the certificate is the public key\nof the server.\nCertificates are a form of key chaining, but are used for authentication\nkeys, not encryption keys.\nAn interloper would have know either\nthe private key of the server or the private key of the\nissuer to successfully impersonate the server.\nAs it turns out, only a handful of issuers, termed\ncertificate authorities\n(CAs), are needed.  For\nexample,\nVeriSign\n, the\nmajor U.S. issuer, issues certificates only after a background\ncheck insures both the identity of the subject, and their\nauthority over a particular DNS name.  VeriSign's public keys\nare hardwired into both Netscape's and Microsoft's web browsers,\nso a web server with a VeriSign-signed certificate can be authenticated by a\nbrowser with no additional information.  If the server presents\na certificate not signed by VeriSign (or another recognized authority),\nor if the DNS name of the server doesn't match the DNS name in\nthe certificate, a warning message is displayed, and the user\nmay decide how to proceed.\nX.509 Certificates\nThe most common type of certificate is an X.509 certificate, an\nASN.1\nencoded block of data specified\nin ISO Standard X.509.\nAs an example of an X.509 certificate,\nhere's a decode (generated with\nopenssl\n)\nof one of\nwww.freesoft.org\n's old certificates; the\nactual certificate is about 1KB in size.

Next comes an RSA public\nkey (modulus and public exponent), followed by the signature, computed\nby taking an MD5 hash of the rest of the certificate and encrypting\nit with Thawte's RSA private key.\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 1 (0x0)\n        Serial Number: 7829 (0x1e95)\n        Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                OU=Certification Services Division,\n                CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Jul  9 16:04:02 1998 GMT\n            Not After : Jul  9 16:04:02 1999 GMT\n        Subject: C=US, ST=Maryland, L=Pasadena, O=Brent Baccala,\n                 OU=FreeSoft, CN=www.freesoft.org/Email=baccala@freesoft.org\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n            RSA Public Key: (1024 bit)\n                Modulus (1024 bit):\n                    00:b4:31:98:0a:c4:bc:62:c1:88:aa:dc:b0:c8:bb:\n                    33:35:19:d5:0c:64:b9:3d:41:b2:96:fc:f3:31:e1:\n                    66:36:d0:8e:56:12:44:ba:75:eb:e8:1c:9c:5b:66:\n                    70:33:52:14:c9:ec:4f:91:51:70:39:de:53:85:17:\n                    16:94:6e:ee:f4:d5:6f:d5:ca:b3:47:5e:1b:0c:7b:\n                    c5:cc:2b:6b:c1:90:c3:16:31:0d:bf:7a:c7:47:77:\n                    8f:a0:21:c7:4c:d0:16:65:00:c1:0f:d7:b8:80:e3:\n                    d2:75:6b:c1:ea:9e:5c:5c:ea:7d:c1:a1:10:bc:b8:\n                    e8:35:1c:9e:27:52:7e:41:8f\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n    Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        93:5f:8f:5f:c5:af:bf:0a:ab:a5:6d:fb:24:5f:b6:59:5d:9d:\n        92:2e:4a:1b:8b:ac:7d:99:17:5d:cd:19:f6:ad:ef:63:2f:92:\n        ab:2f:4b:cf:0a:13:90:ee:2c:0e:43:03:be:f6:ea:8e:9c:67:\n        d0:a2:40:03:f7:ef:6a:15:09:79:a9:46:ed:b7:16:1b:41:72:\n        0d:19:aa:ad:dd:9a:df:ab:97:50:65:f5:5e:85:a6:ef:19:d1:\n        5a:de:9d:ea:63:cd:cb:cc:6d:5d:01:85:b5:6d:c8:f3:d9:f7:\n        8f:0e:fc:ba:1f:34:e9:96:6e:6c:cf:f2:ef:9b:bf:de:b5:22:\n        68:9f\nTo validate this certificate, we need another certificate, one\nthat matches the Issuer (Thawte Server CA) in the first certificate.\nThen we take the RSA public key from the second (CA) certificate,\nuse it to decode the signature on the first certificate to\nobtain an MD5 hash, which must match an actual MD5 hash\ncomputed over the rest of the certificate.\nHere's the CA cert:\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 3 (0x2)\n        Serial Number: 1 (0x1)\n        Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                OU=Certification Services Division,\n                CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Aug  1 00:00:00 1996 GMT\n            Not After : Dec 31 23:59:59 2020 GMT\n        Subject: C=ZA, ST=Western Cape, L=Cape Town, O=Thawte Consulting cc,\n                 OU=Certification Services Division,\n                 CN=Thawte Server CA/Email=server-certs@thawte.com\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n            RSA Public Key: (1024 bit)\n                Modulus (1024 bit):\n                    00:d3:a4:50:6e:c8:ff:56:6b:e6:cf:5d:b6:ea:0c:\n                    68:75:47:a2:aa:c2:da:84:25:fc:a8:f4:47:51:da:\n                    85:b5:20:74:94:86:1e:0f:75:c9:e9:08:61:f5:06:\n                    6d:30:6e:15:19:02:e9:52:c0:62:db:4d:99:9e:e2:\n                    6a:0c:44:38:cd:fe:be:e3:64:09:70:c5:fe:b1:6b:\n                    29:b6:2f:49:c8:3b:d4:27:04:25:10:97:2f:e7:90:\n                    6d:c0:28:42:99:d7:4c:43:de:c3:f5:21:6d:54:9f:\n                    5d:c3:58:e1:c0:e4:d9:5b:b0:b8:dc:b4:7b:df:36:\n                    3a:c2:b5:66:22:12:d6:87:0d\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n        X509v3 extensions:\n            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical\n                CA:TRUE\n    Signature Algorithm: md5WithRSAEncryption\n        07:fa:4c:69:5c:fb:95:cc:46:ee:85:83:4d:21:30:8e:ca:d9:\n        a8:6f:49:1a:e6:da:51:e3:60:70:6c:84:61:11:a1:1a:c8:48:\n        3e:59:43:7d:4f:95:3d:a1:8b:b7:0b:62:98:7a:75:8a:dd:88:\n        4e:4e:9e:40:db:a8:cc:32:74:b9:6f:0d:c6:e3:b3:44:0b:d9:\n        8a:6f:9a:29:9b:99:18:28:3b:d1:e3:40:28:9a:5a:3c:d5:b5:\n        e7:20:1b:8b:ca:a4:ab:8d:e9:51:d9:e2:4c:2c:59:a9:da:b9:\n        b2:75:1b:f6:42:f2:ef:c7:f2:18:f9:89:bc:a3:ff:8a:23:2e:\n        70:47\nThis is an example of a\nself-signed\ncertificate; note that\nthe issuer and subject are the same.  There's no way to verify this\ncertificate except by checking it against itself; we've reached\nthe top of the certificate chain.  So how does this certificate\nbecome trusted?  Simple - it's manually configured.  Thawte is\none of roughly a dozen certificate authorities recognized by\nboth Microsoft and Netscape.  This certificate came with your\nweb browser (you can find it listed in the security settings);\nit's trusted by default.  As a long-lived (note\nthe expiration date), globally trusted certificate that can sign\npretty much anything (note the lack of any constraints), it's\nmatching private key has to be one of the most closely guarded\nin the world.\nWhat would happen if the private key matching the Freesoft\ncertificate was stolen?  The certificate would have to be\nrevoked\n.  Certificate Authorities maintain\nCertificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) indicating which\ncertificates have been revoked before their natural lifespan\nwould expire.\nPGP Certificates\nPGP defines (in\nRFC 2440\n)\nits own certificate format.  PGP certificates are used primarily\nto implement the PGP Web of Trust, a \ncertification system far more decentralized than X.509.\nThe Web of Trust defines trust relationships based on personal\ncertification by known and trusted individuals.  To participate\nin the Web of Trust, you need to find someone already trusted\nto certify you.\n\\begin{soapbox}\nOther than it's far more decentralized nature, the PGP\nWeb of Trust is actual quite similar to the X.509 system.\nThough neither the PGP nor the X.509 certificate design\nis completely satisfactory,\nin fact most PGP certificates could be converted into\nparallel X.509 certificates, and the entire Web of Trust\nreproduced using X.509 syntax.  Likewise, X.509 certificates\ncould implement a Web of Trust.  Using off-the-shelf tools like\nopenssl\n, I could create\na Freesoft Certificate Authority, have it authenticated by\nother, well-known websites, and in turn authenticate other sites.\nYet the X.509 system has been adopted by corporate America,\nand it shows.  The average X.509 certificate expires in a year\nor two and costs at least $100.\nRenewals typically cost almost as much as the original.\nThat's just for a server\ncertificate, that can't be used to sign other certificates.\nChaining certificates, that can sign other certificates,\ncost thousands of dollars, though there are some real\ntechnical issues here that need to be resolved before\nchaining certificates can be more widely used.\nA solution may be on the horizon in the form of secure DNS.\nA DNS resource record type (CERT) has been defined\n(\nRFC 2538\n)\nto carry X.509 or PGP certificates.\nProgress is being made (see\nRFC 3130\n)\ntowards cryptographically securing DNS, so within a few years\nwe may see signed DNS domains that can carry CERT records.\nIn my opinion, this would make a lot more sense than the present\nscheme... if corporate America moves to adopt it.\n\\end{soapbox}\nNext:\nDatagrams and Streams\nConnected: An Internet Encyclopedia\nCertificates",
