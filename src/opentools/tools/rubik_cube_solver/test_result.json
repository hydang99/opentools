The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'U3 D3 U' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 green squares in the front face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 0\nB. 3\nC. 9\nD. 7",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'D2 U2 B2' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 grey squares in the up face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 5\nB. 3\nC. 2\nD. 1",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R3 B2' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 yellow squares in the back face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 7\nB. 9\nC. 1\nD. 6",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'F3 U' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 orange squares in the up face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 9\nB. 3\nC. 5\nD. 0",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R3 B3 D2' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 red squares in the up face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 1\nB. 4\nC. 8\nD. 6",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 green squares in the back face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 0\nB. 2\nC. 6\nD. 5",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'D' starting from the state shown in the image.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'F' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 grey squares in the left face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 4\nB. 0\nC. 2\nD. 6",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 red squares in the right face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 2\nB. 0\nC. 8\nD. 9",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'D3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 grey squares in the down face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 3\nB. 6\nC. 9\nD. 8",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'L' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 yellow squares in the back face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 5\nB. 8\nC. 7\nD. 6",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'U2 B B2' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 orange squares in the back face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 4\nB. 3\nC. 2\nD. 1",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'L L D3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 blue squares in the left face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 2\nB. 4\nC. 1\nD. 5",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'F3 R3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 yellow squares in the right face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 1\nB. 3\nC. 5\nD. 0",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees.clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'U D3 D' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 red squares in the up face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 4\nB. 1\nC. 9\nD. 0",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R2' starting from the state shown in the image.

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'R3 R3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 red squares in the up face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 2\nB. 3\nC. 7\nD. 0",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'F3 F2 L3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 orange squares in the front face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 1\nB. 0\nC. 3\nD. 8",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'F2 U2' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 red squares in the down face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 8\nB. 6\nC. 3\nD. 7",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'D B2 D3' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 green squares in the back face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 2\nB. 5\nC. 8\nD. 3",

The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCD.\nA 3 * 3 Rubik's Cube has six different coloured panels: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, and grey. The initial state of the cube in terms of the different colour positions in its six faces is shown in the image. To represent the movements of the cube we use six letters: U for Up, D for Down, L for Left, R for Right, F for Front, B for Back. These letters are used in sequence where you need to perform each letter in the sequence from left to right. Each letter tells you to move that face clockwise by 90 degrees. A number 'n' immediately after a letter denotes that you need to move that face clockwise by 90 * n degrees. For example, 'U R3' would mean rotating the up face 90 degrees clockwise and then rotating the right face 270 degrees clockwise. You perform the move sequence 'L3 B3 R2' starting from the state shown in the image. What would be the number of small 1 * 1 grey squares in the right face after completing the move sequence?\nA. 6\nB. 5\nC. 4\nD. 7",
