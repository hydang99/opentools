        "\n",
        "This notebook compares several agent styles **before** you see their traces. At a high level:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ZeroShot**: Single LLM call, **no tools**, no explicit planning. Fast and cheap, but can be brittle on harder tasks. The result dictionary mainly has a `direct_output` string.\n",
        "- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Still **no tools**, but the LLM is prompted to reason step-by-step. You will usually see a longer textual reasoning trace and a final answer in `direct_output`.\n",
        "- **ReAct**: Alternates between **Thought → Action (tool) → Observation**. The logs show multiple \"ReAct Reasoning Cycle\" steps, tool calls, and observations, followed by a **Final Answer** section.\n",
        "- **OctoTools**: Uses a more structured **plan → tool calls → memory** loop. The trace is broken into named steps such as *Query Analysis*, *Action Prediction*, *Command Generation*, *Command Execution*, and *Context Verification*, plus a final summary.\n",
        "- **OpenTools (more detailed)**: Think of this as a **small team of sub-agents** working together:\n",
        "  1. **Input**: You pass a single `question` (and optional `image_path` / extra kwargs) into `UnifiedSolver(..., agent_name=\"opentools\", ...)`.\n",
        "  2. **Reasoner sub-agent**: Reads the question (and global memory) and breaks it into a **sub-problem** like “find this paper” or “compute this quantity and explain it”. This shows up in the logs as `sub_problem=...`.\n",
        "  3. **Tool-call generator**: Given that sub-problem, it decides **which tools** to call (e.g. `Arxiv_Paper_Search_Tool`, `Search_Engine_Tool`, `Visual_AI_Tool`) and with what arguments. You will see a list of `Generated Tool calls: [...]`.\n",
        "  4. **Executor**: Actually runs those tools and records raw results (JSON, text, etc.). This is where you see `Executed Tool calls: [...]` with concrete outputs.\n",
        "  5. **Verifier**: Checks whether the tool results really answer the sub-problem, may clean up the output, and writes a concise summary.\n",
        "  6. **Global memory**: The verified summary is stored in a shared memory dict (keyed by step index). Later reasoning cycles can **read this memory** instead of re-calling tools.\n",
        "  7. **Loop + stopping**: Steps 2–6 repeat, using the growing memory, until the reasoner marks `stop=True`.\n",
        "  8. **Final answer**: A final summarization step reads from global memory and produces a **single, user-facing answer**. In Python, you’ll see this in `result[\"direct_output\"]` or `result[\"final_output\"]`, while the long trace (logs + memory) explains how that answer was constructed.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you only care about the answer, focus on `direct_output` / `final_output`. If you want to understand *how* the agent solved the problem, scroll up through the OpenTools log and follow the numbered reasoning cycles and memory updates."

Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\\nComments:\\n89 pages, 18 figures.

Existing methods augment large language models (LLMs) with external tools but are restricted to specialized domains, limited tool types, or require additional training data. In this paper, we introduce OctoTools, a training-free, user-friendly, and easily extensible open-source agentic framework designed to tackle complex reasoning across diverse domains. OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools. Through comprehensive analysis and ablations, OctoTools demonstrates advantages in task planning, effective tool usage, and multi-step problem solving.\\nComments:\\n89 pages, 18 figures.

            "   - **Limitations**: The tool requires an OpenAI API key for analysis, and processing time may vary based on image size and complexity. Additionally, the quality of analysis depends on the clarity of the image.\n",

            "### Additional Considerations\n",

OctoTools introduces standardized tool cards to encapsulate tool functionality, a planner for both high-level and low-level planning, and an executor to carry out tool usage. We validate OctoTools\\' generality across 16 diverse tasks (including MathVista, MMLU-Pro, MedQA, and GAIA-Text), achieving substantial average accuracy gains of 9.3% over GPT-4o. Furthermore, OctoTools outperforms AutoGen, GPT-Functions and LangChain by up to 10.6% when given the same set of tools.
